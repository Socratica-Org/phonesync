Download the CSV file from the Luma system.

Rename it to `luma.csv` and put it in the `preprocessing` directory (this one).

Run the script:

```bash
python process.py
```

- This will create a `attendees.json` file in the `preprocessing` directory.
- Move this into `web/src/server/attendees.json`
